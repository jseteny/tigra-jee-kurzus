This is a sample project for developing a Web Service starting from Java code and using JBossWS.

The project has the usual Maven structure and is built with:

> mvn clean package

To deploy the generated WAR archive to a running WildFly instance use:

> mvn wildfly:deploy

Once the WAR is deployed, the integration testsuite is run with:

> mvn integration-test

Finally, you can undeploy the WAR with:

> mvn wildfly:undeploy
